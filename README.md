# SNL 2023 Abstract A91
repository for abstract #A91 at the 2023 Society for the Neurobiology of Language meeting in Marseille, France (poster title: "complex lexico-semantic networks: cross-linguistic comparison of embedding cosine similarity and human free word associations").

Within the pecanpy_walks subdirectory you will find a script (work in progress) that runs random walks across a matrix based on the positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) of words in a wikipedia corpus, pulled from hugging face (/olm/wikipedia). I greatly appreciate any comments, raised issues or contributions to this script. We'd like to compare the output from this approach to those results derived from the fastText wikipedia embeddings.
